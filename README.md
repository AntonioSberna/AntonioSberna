Hi, I’m AntonioSberna
I’m currently a PhD student at [Polytechnique University of Turin](https://www.polito.it/?lang=en).
My research activities are currently focusing on the optimization of seismic retrofitting interventions in existing structures [(see my last pubblications)](https://antoniosberna.github.io/publication/).
