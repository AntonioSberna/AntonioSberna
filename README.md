# Welcome

Hi, you just reached the profile of [Antonio Sberna](https://antoniosberna.github.io/), a Research Fellow at the [Polytechnic University of Turin](https://www.polito.it/?lang=en). My research centers on developing innovative approaches to optimize **seismic retrofitting** interventions for existing structures, leveraging both **evolutionary algorithms** and **parametric models**. My recent publications can be found [here](https://antoniosberna.github.io/publication/).

> *Note*: Due to scientific publication requirements, most of my repositories are currently private. However, I’m working on making several projects public in the near future.

## 🔍 Research Interests
- **Seismic Engineering**: Strategies for retrofitting and enhancing the resilience of existing structures
- **Optimization Algorithms**: Applying AI and evolutionary computation to solve engineering problems
- **Structural Analysis**: Using tools like OpenSees to simulate structural behavior under seismic loads and so
